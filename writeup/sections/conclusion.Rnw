\section{Conclusion}

The Markov Model and the simulations give a more generalized but still simplified view of population survival on a many generational voyage. The expected survival time calculated from the fundamental matrix of the Markov model indicates a small number of population can survive for a long time. For example for a population of 10, the surviving time is over 9000. This theoretical result is ideal and not meaningful when compared with the result from the simulation since the assumptions are over simplifed.  

From the more realistic but still simplified simulation, we observe that increasing the max population increases the population robustness linearly. We estimated the parameters for the linear model in order to be able to predict the distribution of expected survival times based on different max population values. As an exploratory project, we observed that increasing the maximum age of the population decreases the robustness. Increasing the fertility rate increased robustness but reached an asymptotic limit. A further exploration would determine inter relationships among max population, max age, and fertility rate. 

An effective model will be able to predict the minimum population to send on a multi generational space voyage. For example, if the voyage will take 500 years, the model should be able to predict the minimum number of people to send on the voyage to ensure 95\% confidence without depleting resources. Potential steps forward may include further developing the markov model (see appendix) or the simulations.

%Population simulation can be applied to any system where reproducing entities are left to their own devices for several generations. While we have applied that model to multi generational space travel, this can also be applied to invasive species in a an environment with set limited resources, such as a pond or valley.
